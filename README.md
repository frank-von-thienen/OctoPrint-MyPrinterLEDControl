# MyPrinterLEDControl

This plugin sets the LEDs irt to the printer's status.
Actually, it sets the LEDS from RED (set in GCODE scrip from OctoPrint) to WHITE.
So we have better light to illuminate the print for the web cam.

In addition, I set a view parameters for my wb cam, to make sure we have no automation
for white balancing, exposure and auto focus.


## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)
or manually using this URL:
